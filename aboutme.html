      <h2>Trisha Erickson</h2>
      
      <p>Aloha! My name is Trisha. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.  Some of my hobbies include outdoor activities, such as hiking, swimming, and gardening.  I also enjoy reading, listening to music, and playing the piano and guitar.  I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and have been a member my entire life.</p>
      
      <p>I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science because when I was looking into going back to work, I wanted to find something meaningful.  After talking to many small business owners in our local area, I learned that there is so much potential to help them by being able to give them affordable software solutions.  Many people in my area have to work two or three different jobs to make ends meet. I felt that learning software development skills might offer job opportunities where I can assist local business owners with solutions to ease some of their workloads.</p>
      
      <p>I love the growth I have experienced both temporally and spiritually through the BYU Pathways program.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to be able to participate and learn with everyone here.</p>
