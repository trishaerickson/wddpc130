      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the Dry Oar website is to increase the company’s visibility to existing customers and to attract new customers through marketing the company’s services and products. In turn, this will increase revenue for the Dry Oar company. The Dry Oar company offers equipment rentals for white water rafting, river floats, fly fishing floats, and river surfing. The company provides guided river rafting tours, fly fishing tours, and river surfing lessons. The website offers the ability to explore and reserve equipment and guided tours. The site also has a photo gallery showcasing products that customers can purchase at the store, but customers will not be able to buy the products online. There will also be a photo gallery highlighting customer experiences and showcasing the rivers that the tours go through.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Dry Oar's target audience is tourists who are vacationing and want to experience white water rafting, relaxing river floats, fly fishing floats, or river surfing during their vacation. We target corporations wanting to create management retreats or team-building experiences or business travelers who have an extra day and want to experience river activities.  Another target audience is residents who want to rent equipment to help decide if they're going to purchase equipment. Our goal is to create memories and experiences for our customers that they will keep for a lifetime.  The audience will access the site using any internet browser on a desktop computer or a laptop.  They will also access the site on an iOS or android electronic tablet, or a mobile device.</p>

        Style Guide

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/160c28-fff8f0-8c1c13-f9c22e-554971">https://coolors.co/160c28-fff8f0-8c1c13-f9c22e-554971</a></p>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">#F1FAEE</td><td class="secondary">#457B9D</td><td class="accent1">#E63946</td><td class="accent2">#1D3557</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Anton
      </h4>
      <p>
        Anton has a good contrast from the paragraph text, which allows a clear separation for each section.  It also allows a user to identify each section as they scroll through the page quickly.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Roboto
      </h4>
      <p>
        Roboto is simple and compfortable text to read.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you. 
      </p>

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
